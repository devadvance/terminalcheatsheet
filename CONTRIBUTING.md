# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project!

## Steps to contribute

This is a small project right now, so the steps are fairly quick:

* Check out the [README](README.md) for instructions on getting up and running. It also covers the tech we use and how the site is structure and deployed.
* (Recommended) use an issue to let folks know you're going to work on something. Either ask if you can be added to an existing issue, or create a new one and add yourself.
* Fork the repo and make changes in a branch on your fork.
* As of 2020Q4, we merge directly to head, so create a [pull request](https://github.com/devadvance/terminalcheatsheet/compare) against the default branch.

For any pull request, we prefer these be included:

* Confirmation that it has been tested and validates with GitHub Pages and AMP.
* Matches the style of the existing code.
* Has good commit messages.

## License

Visit [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details on how all code in this project is and will be licensed.

## All content must be localized

tl;dr we want to make sure content on is translated and otherwise localized when it's initially added (preferred) or as a fast follow (not preferred).

Visit the [README](README.md) for how to localize and the structure we use.

## Don't know where to start?

A good place to start is checking the [existing issues](https://github.com/devadvance/terminalcheatsheet/issues) to check if something interests you. If not, you are welcome add a new issue and (optionally) pick it up!
